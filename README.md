# Spam-Message-Detection-Using-Naive-Bayes-Classifier

With the borrowed dataset of messages, the words are tokenized and used to develop a vocabulary which would then be used to vectorize each message based on the list of essential vocabulary. 
So the tools used are count vectorizer, then tfidf transformer and then finally the multinomial naive bayes classifier by which the messages could be classified as spam and non spam with an F1 score of 0.97. Thanks for viewing this project.
